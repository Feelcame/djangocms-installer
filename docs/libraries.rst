Libraries installation issues
=============================

While this wizard tries to handle most of the things for you, it doesn't check for
all the proper native (non python) libraries to be installed.
Before running this, please check you have the proper header and libraries
installed and available for packages to be installed.

Libraries you would want to check:

* libjpeg (for JPEG support in ``Pillow``)
* zlib (for PNG support in ``Pillow``)
* postgresql (for ``psycopg``)
* libmysqlclient (for ``Mysql-Python``)

The actual package name may vary depending on the platform / distribution you
are using; you should make sure you have the library headers file installed
(mostly contained in package with ``-dev`` in its name: e.g. ``libjpeg-dev`` for
``libjpeg`` library).

Examples
^^^^^^^^

The following are examples based on major distributions versions at the time of writing.

This may may vary over time with distribution changes and may be out of date / unsuitable
for you distribution.

The rationale should stand over the time, though, even if package manager and packages may
change name and if a package name does not match when your these commands, a quick search
using your distribution package manager should help you to find the right name.


Debian / Ubuntu
---------------

* Pillow: ``sudo apt-get install libtiff5-dev libjpeg8-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev``
* Postgres: ``sudo apt-get install libpq-dev``
* MySQL: ``sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev``


Fedora
------

* Python: ``dnf install python3-devel gcc`` (or ``dnf install python-devel gcc``)
* Pillow: ``dnf install libtiff-devel libjpeg-devel libzip-devel freetype-devel lcms2-devel libwebp-devel zlib-devel``
* Postgres: ``dnf install postgresql-devel``
* MySQL: ``dnf install mysql-devel`` (or ``yum install mariadb-devel``)


CentOS / yum based distributions
--------------------------------

* Python: ``yum install python3-devel gcc`` (or ``yum install python-devel gcc``)
* Pillow: ``yum install libjpeg-devel libpng-devel libtiff-devel freetype-devel zlib-devel``
* Postgres: ``yum install postgresql-devel``
* MySQL: ``yum install mysql-devel`` (or ``yum install mariadb-devel``)


Fixing libraries installation issues
------------------------------------

If a native library is missing when installing a python package, the package
installation may fail silently or the package may be missing some functionality
(e.g.: if libjpeg is not installed Pillow will be compiled without JPEG support).

``djangocms-installer`` tries to check for most common issues and will exit with
an exception in case of errors.

In case of package installation failure you can simply install the correct
library and execute ``djangocms-installer`` again with the same parameters; if
the package is compiled with some functionality missing, you have to first
deinstall it (``pip uninstall *package-name*``), then install the correct library
and the execute ``djangocms-installer`` again.

* Reinstall ``pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-deps djangocms-installer``

For older Debian / Ubuntu releases, a manual fix may be needed to properly fix
compilation issues: see `stackoverflow`_

Manual installation
-------------------

If all else fails, you can use :ref:`dump_mode` to create a requirements file,
install it by hand and run the installer with ``-n`` parameter.
